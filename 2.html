  <h2>Yoga Diary</h2>
I love Yoga. I really do. I will do a business related to yoga like operating yoga studio, creating some goods and selling.
I am serious about this. I will make money with this. I mean, it's not that I only think about money with yoga. I really love doing it.
I go to the class every morning 6 times a week in average. It helps me feel calm, peaceful, and makes me a better person. I feel I am growing everyday as I'm doing yoga.
One of my goal is to go to India and do yoga.
